# 🧠✈️ Multi-AI Agent Travel Planner

A **Multi-AI Agent Travel Planner** that helps users plan trips effortlessly using simple commands. Designed to streamline travel planning, this tool uses multiple AI agents working collaboratively to suggest destinations, build itineraries, find flights, book hotels, and more.

## 🚀 Features

* 🗺️ **Destination Suggestions** – Based on user preferences, interests, or current trends.
* 📅 **Itinerary Builder** – Auto-generates travel plans, including places to visit, timings, and routes.
* 🏨 **Hotel Finder** – Recommends accommodations near the planned destinations.
* ✈️ **Flight Search** – Helps find optimal flight routes and times.
* 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture** – AI agents communicate and coordinate to ensure a smooth planning process.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-ai-travel-planner.git
cd multi-ai-travel-planner

## 🧠 How It Works

The system uses multiple specialized AI agents:

* **Planner Agent**: Understands user goals and timelines.
* **Flight Agent**: Searches and compares flight options.
* **Hotel Agent**: Finds suitable places to stay.
* **Location Agent**: Chooses sightseeing spots and local experiences.

These agents communicate in the background to build a complete trip plan from just a few user inputs.

## 🛠️ Usage

Run the planner:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then enter your command, for example:

```
Plan a 7-day solo trip to Thailand with a focus on beaches and local food.
```

The system will generate a customized travel plan.
